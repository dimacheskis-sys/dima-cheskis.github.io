This week, Ashkan will introduce his research progress on Simultaneous MT.  A zoom link will be sent tomorrow morning.

**Our recent progress on Simultaneous Machine Translation**

**Abstract:**
Simultaneous neural machine translation (SNMT) aims to maintain translation quality while minimizing the delay between reading the input and incrementally producing the output. The eventual goal of SNMT is to match the performance of highly skilled human interpreters who can simultaneously listen to a speaker in a source language and produce a translation in the target language with minimal delay.
In this presentation I will talk about our latest progress on generating more efficient policies to balance the trade-off between translation quality and delay.
