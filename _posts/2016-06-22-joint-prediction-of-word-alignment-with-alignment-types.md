At the June 22nd lab meeting (11:30am), Anahita will talk about Joint
Prediction of Word Alignment with Alignment Types.

Abstract: Probabilistic models for word alignment do not distinguish between
different types of word alignment links. We provide a new probabilistic model
for word alignment in which alignments are associated with linguistically
motivated alignment types. We provide a novel task of joint prediction of word
alignment and alignment types.
