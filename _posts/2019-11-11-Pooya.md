**Interpretable neural models in NLP**

**Abstract:** *Neural models have become the state-of-the-art in many machine learning applications. However, they usually do not explain their predictions which is a barrier for understanding their behaviors and trusting them specially for critical settings. In this presentation we investigate several NLP papers which have tried to propose interpretable neural models as a remedy. (bearbeitet)*
