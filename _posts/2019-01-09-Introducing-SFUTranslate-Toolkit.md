In our lab meeting this week, Hassan will introduce the new Neural Machine Translation Toolkit developed recently in the lab.
The toolkit is designed so that the different parts of the model in the data prepration, model creation and training process, 
are simply accessible and alterable modules with very little dependacy on each other. The main objective of the toolkit is to
facilitate the process of implementing new models and ideas, as much as possible.

Wednesday, January 9th, 11:00 a.m. TASC1 9408.
