In our lab meeting tomorrow, Jetic will give a talk on recent NMT papers, more
specifically those tackling inconsistencies, model compression, and training
efficiencies.
Here is the title and abstract:

**Beyond Chasing After BLEU Scores II**

**Abstract:**
*Neural machine translation models while offer great performance promises on
paper suffer severely in production, where inconsistencies in translation,
huge model sizes and expensive training and inference operations hindering
reliability and cost-efficiencies.
In this presentation (1/2), we look at recent NMT papers published inproc
ACL2019 that may help with these very specific issues.*
