In our lab meeting tomorrow, Logan will discuss his summer internship at the CDLI (Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative).

A Zoom link will be posted to Twist on the morning of the meeting. 

**NLP Tools for Sumerian**

**Abstract:**
 He will give an overview of the state of NLP tools for ancient near eastern languages, with a focus on Sumerian. He will introduce a variety of monolingual and parallel corpora with varying degrees of annotation. He will highlight the shortcomings of these datasets, which can be incomplete and sometimes require extensive cleaning in order to be useful. He also plan to survey existing tools for NLP tasks such as translation and POS tagging, and to highlight areas where these tools are missing or inadequate.

He will demonstrate some of these issues using case studies from his own work, which extracted information about counted objects in Sumerian accounting tablets. Lastly, he will survey another project completed at the CDLI this summer, which worked to improve Sumerian-English machine translation.
