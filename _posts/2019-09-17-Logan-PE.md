In our lab meeting this week, Logan will talk about some recent work on the analysis of the undeciphered proto-Elamite script that he presented in a NAACL 2019 workshop. The title and abstract of the talk:

**Sign Clustering and Topic Extraction in Proto-Elamite**

**Abstract:** *We describe a first attempt at using techniques from computational linguistics to analyze the undeciphered proto-Elamite script. Using hierarchical clustering, n-gram frequencies, and LDA topic models, we both replicate results obtained by manual decipherment and reveal previously-unobserved relationships between signs. This demonstrates the utility of these techniques as an aid to manual decipherment.*
