In our lab meeting this week, Zhenqi will talk abou fine-grained entity recognition. The title and abstract of his talk:

**Overview of latest  works on fine-grained and ultra-fine entity recognition**

**Abstract:** Recent works on fine-grained entity typing task has shift their attentions from encoding mention and context to a better type embedding. We will present four latest works on the fine-grained and ultra-fine entity recognition task and explore techniques such as zero-shot learning, graph convolution network and hyperbolic space of embedding entity types.
