Our first lab meeting for summer semester starts with Logan. Here is the title and abstract of his talk:

Title: A Weight-Preserving Lexicalization for Weighted Synchronous Context-Free Grammars.

Abstract: This is a practice talk for an upcoming presentation at WATA 2018. The talk will present an algorithm which lexicalizes a weighted SCFG without changing the weight which it assigns to strings. We also show that it is possible to normalize the lexicalized grammar into a probabilistic SCFG, and we evaluate the lexicalized grammars on a synthetic inference task.

Wednesday, May 2nd, 10-11 AM, Location: TASC1 9408.
