**Neural Knowledge-Based Systems in NLP**

**Abstract:**
*Recent years have seen wide applications of external knowledge sources in
  end-to-end NLP tasks.
  Statistical and rule-based methods often rely on utilisation of logical
  representations, which do allow for easier integration but is limited when
  it comes to complex implicit inference.
  For neural models, the ability to better handle ambiguous information has
  allowed for far more powerful inference and deduction capabilities, but since
  neural network's internal states are often represented as uninterpretable
  vectors, more efforts are necessary to leverage structured knowledge and
  develop more extensible and powerful intelligent agents.
  This paper highlights recent advances in utilisation of knowledge bases in
  neural models, and also important research topics around neural knowledge
  bases themselves.*
