In our lab meeting tomorrow, Hassan will introduce a Neural Machine Translation method based on linguistic feature extraction. A Zoom link will be posted to Twist on the morning of the meeting. 

**Linguistic Feature Extraction from BERT for Neural Machine Translation**

**Abstract:**
The emergence of massively pre-trained language models (e.g. BERT) would intuitively lead to study the usefulness of such models in improving the accuracy of translation models. In this presentation, we focus on feature extraction from BERT while discussing the improvements of the extracted feature vectors in Neural Machine Translation framework. We will also cover some background from the other papers suggesting closely related ideas.
