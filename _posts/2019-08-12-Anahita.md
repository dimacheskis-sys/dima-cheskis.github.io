In our lab meeting this week, Anahita will talk about part-of-speech induction. The title and abstract of her talk:

**Inducing Multilingual Text Analysis Tools via Robust Projection across Aligned Corpora**

**Abstract:** *We will discuss the seminal work of Yarowsky and Ngai (2001) for inducing part-of-speech taggers for languages that have no annotated training data, but have translated text in a resource-rich language. This method does not assume any knowledge about the target language (no tagging dictionary is assumed), making it applicable to a wide array of resource-poor languages.*

Tuesday, August 13thth, 12:00 p.m. TASC1 9408.
