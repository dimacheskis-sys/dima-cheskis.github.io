In the lab meeting tomorrow, Ashkan will give a talk about Real-Time Neural
Machine Translation. Here is a brief description of his talk:

Simultaneous translation differs from a more usual consecutive translation. In
simultaneous translation, the objective of a translator, or a translation
system, is defined as a combination of quality and delay, as opposed to
consecutive translation in which translation quality alone matters. In order to
minimize delay while maximizing quality, a simultaneous translator must start
generating symbols in a target languages before a full source sentence is
received. In our meeting, I will talk about the main Ideas and approaches
presented in two novel papers in this area of research. Here's their links:
