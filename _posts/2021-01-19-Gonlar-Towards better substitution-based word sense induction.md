In our lab meeting tomorrow, Golnar will give us a review on a paper of word sense induction.

**Towards better substitution-based word sense induction**

**Abstract:**
Word sense induction (WSI) is the task of unsupervised clustering of word usages within a sentence to distinguish senses. Recent work obtain strong results by clustering lexical substitutes derived from pre-trained RNN language models (ELMo). Adapting the method to BERT improves the scores even further. We extend the previous method to support a dynamic rather than a fixed number of clusters as supported by other prominent methods, and propose a method for interpreting the resulting clusters by associating them with their most informative substitutes. We then perform extensive error analysis revealing the remaining sources of errors in the WSI task.
