In the lab meeting today, Nishant will give a talk about handling
Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words in Machine Translation. Here is a brief
description of his talk:

Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words - words that appear in the recognition task at
hand, but not in the training set - are a ubiquitous and difficult problem in
machine translation. Data-driven machine translation systems are able to
translate words that have been seen in the training corpora, however
translating unseen words is still a bottleneck for even the best performing
systems. In general, the amount of parallel data is finite which results in
infrequent terms to be absent in the training parallel corpora. This lack of
information can potentially produce incomplete, erroneous and disfluent
translations. In this discussion, we will investigate the different approaches
of handling OOVs in Statistical Machine Translation leading up to Neural
Machine Translation.
