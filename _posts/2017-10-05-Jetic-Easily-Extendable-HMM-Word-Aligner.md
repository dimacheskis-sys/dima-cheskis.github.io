In our lab meeting tomorrow (October 5th), Jetic will talk about an easily extendable HMM word aligner. Here's the abstarct of his talk:
Abstract: We present a new word aligner with built-in support for alignment types. It is an open source software that can be easily extended to use models of usersâ€™ own design. We expect it to suffice the academics as well as scientists working in the industry to do word alignment and experiments on their own new models. The basic designs and structures of the Aligner will be introduced.
