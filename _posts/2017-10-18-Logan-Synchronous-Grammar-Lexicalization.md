Logan will be talking about Synchronous Grammar Lexicalization in our lab meeting tomorrow(Oct 19th). Here is the abstract of his talk:

This work presents two results in the field of formal language theory. The first result shows that the class of synchronous context free grammars (SCFG) cannot prefix lexicalize itself; the second shows that SCFG is prefix lexicalized by the class of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars (STAG). We present an algorithm for converting an SCFG to an equivalent prefix lexicalized STAG, and demonstrate that the conversion does not excessively increase the size or parse complexity of the grammar. We conclude with a discussion of some practical applications to word alignment and hierarchical translation decoding.
