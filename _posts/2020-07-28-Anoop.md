In our lab meeting tomorrow, Anoop will cover two papers on neural module networks.

A Zoom link will be posted to Twist on the morning of the meeting. 

**Neural Module Networks**

**Abstract:**
Anoop will cover some papers on neural module networks which have previously been applied to VQA and to reading comprehension tasks. However, in my estimation their potential applicability will be quite widespread in NLP even though it was introduced quite some time ago (in 2015) and we haven't seen it take off yet. We will cover the following papers:

Neural Module Networks. Jacob Andreas, Marcus Rohrbach, Trevor Darrell, Dan Klein. https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02799.

Neural Module Networks for Reasoning over Text. Nitish Gupta, Kevin Lin, Dan Roth, Sameer Singh, Matt Gardner. https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04971

Tuesday, July 28th, 09:30 a.m.
