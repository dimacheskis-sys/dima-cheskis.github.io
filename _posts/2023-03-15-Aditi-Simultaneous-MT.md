Glad to announce that we're finally restarting our weekly lab meetings and reading group after a brief hiatus. Going forward, we'll have our lab meetings on Wednesdays, 11:30 AM. 

For this week's **online** lab meeting Aditi will present a review of some of the recent approaches on Simultaneous MT. 

Simultaneous Machine Translation defines a task of generating high-quality translation under low latency. Existing SiMT methods are divided into fixed (Wait-k, Multi-Path Wait-k, MoE Wait-k) and adaptive policies (MiLk, MMA etc.). She will be presenting an overview of the various approaches taken towards this task, and specifically present these 5 papers :
has selected three papers to survey from EMNLP:

1. Ma et al., "[Monotonic Multihead Attention](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Hyg96gBKPS)", ICLR 2020
2. Zhang et al., "[Wait-info Policy: Balancing Source and Target at Information Level for Simultaneous Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11220.pdf)", EMNLP 2022
3. Zhang et al., "[Modeling Dual Read/Write Paths for Simultaneous Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.130/)", ACL 2022
4. Alinejad et al., "[Translation-based Supervision for Policy Generation in Simultaneous Neural Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.130/)", EMNLP 2021
5. Deng et al., "[Improving Simultaneous Machine Translation with Monolingual Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01188.pdf)", AAAI 2023

Wednesday, 15 March at 11:30.

The zoom link will be posted on zulip.
