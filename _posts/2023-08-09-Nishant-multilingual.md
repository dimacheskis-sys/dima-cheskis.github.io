At this week's lab meeting, Nishant will present a brief review tracking the current state of multilingual machine translation: 

**Abstract**:  Multilingual Neural Machine Translation has been useful in improving translation quality as a result of inherent transfer learning. It is promising and interesting because end-to-end modeling and distributed representations over several languages at once open new avenues for research on machine translation. We first categorize various approaches based on their central use-case and then further categorize them based on resource scenarios, underlying modeling principles, core-issues and challenges. Wherever possible we address the strengths and weaknesses of several techniques by comparing them with each other.
