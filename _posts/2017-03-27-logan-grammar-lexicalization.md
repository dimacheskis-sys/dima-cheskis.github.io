In the next lab meeting, Logan will be talking about grammar lexicalization.
Here is a brief description of his talk:

I'll introduce Greibach normal form (2GNF) for CFGs, and discuss some
applications for prefix lexicalized grammars. I'll then demonstrate that 2GNF
cannot be used to lexicalize certain synchronous grammars, as the
lexicalization algorithm would destroy some of the alignments in the original
grammar. Finally, I will briefly introduce a different grammar formalism which
may be able to retain more alignments when lexicalized. Time permitting, I'll
close by sharing some of the properties of these grammars which Anoop and I are
investigating.
