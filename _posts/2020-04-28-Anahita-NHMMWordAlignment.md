In our lab meeting tomorrow, Anahita will introduce a Neural method for  Word Alignment. A Zoom link will be posted to Twist on the morning of the meeting. 

**Neural Hidden Markov Model for Word Alignment**

**Abstract:**
We present our results for neuralizing an unsupervised Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for word alignment. This work proposes a hidden Markov model with neural network-based lexicon and alignment models, which are trained jointly using the Baum-Welch algorithm. Our experimental results show that neural HMM generally outperforms its GIZA++ IBM4 baseline.
