Lab meetings will resume at the usual time starting next week (Tuesday, 21 April, 9:30 a.m.). A Zoom meeting ID will be posted prior to the meeting which you can use to join. In preparation for the meeting, please take the time to set up a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) account using your SFU email address. Without an account, you should still be able to join the meetings, but you will not be able to host a meeting as a presenter.
