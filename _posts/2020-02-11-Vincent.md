In our lab meeting tomorrow, Vincent will give a brief talk about his research in Nested Named Entity Recognition.

Here are the title and abstract:

**Nested Named Entity Recognition**

**Abstract:**
Many named entities may contain other named entities inside them, especially in the biomedical domain. For instance, “Bank of China and University of Washington”, both organizations with nested locations. However, due to some technological reasons, the nested structure had been arbitrarily ignored for a long time, and only the outmost entities were considered, which literally lost the original semantic meanings. Since Manning firstly proposed a discriminative constituency parser for nested named entities recognition in 2009, many methods have been employed to detect them successfully. In this talk, we will review the main datasets for Nested NER and some approaches published in recent conferences.
