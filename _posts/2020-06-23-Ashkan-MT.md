In our lab meeting tomorrow, Ashkan will introduce Automatic Speech Translation.
A Zoom link will be posted to Twist on the morning of the meeting. 

**Reformer: The Efficient Transformer**

**Abstract:**
Automatic Speech Translation (AST) aims to directly translate audio signals in the source language, into the text words in the target language. For many years, the pipeline of transcribing speech with ASR and then translating with the MT component was a standard method to address the speech translation problem. In recent years, it has shown that we can remove the transcription step and build an end-to-end model that is strong enough to compete with the cascaded model. In this talk I go through the most influential ideas in this research direction.
