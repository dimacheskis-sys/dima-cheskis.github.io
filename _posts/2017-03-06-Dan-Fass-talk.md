Today in the lab meeting, Dan Fass will be leading the discussion. The title of
his talk is "A Selected Review of N-gram Research and Two Proposals". Here is a
brief description of his talk:

N-grams are widely used in NLP applications such as statistical machine
translation, speech recognition, optical character recognition, and spelling
correction.  Three research groups are notable for developing n-grams that
combine lexical and syntactic information of various types.  A representation
for n-gram information is proposed that attempts to reconcile differences
between those n-grams, along with a classification underpinning the proposed
representation and others. Potential applications and extensions of the
representation are briefly described.
