title: "Vivian's Talk on Transition-Based Feed-Forward Neural Networks for Sequence Tagging"
root: ../../
---

In this week's lab meeting, Vivian will talk about using transition-based
feed-forward neural networks for sequence tagging (part-of-speech tagging,
chunking, and named entity recognition). While existing LSTM networks have
produced impressive results on such tasks, simple feed-forward neural networks
can achieve comparable results. Finding a balance of speed and accuracy is an
interest of this project.
