**Recent work on Memory Network**

**Abstract:**
Recent years have seen wide applications of external knowledge sources in end-to-end NLP tasks. Through the use of memory network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) alongside variants of attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014), neural models can directly access information from a much wider variety of sources such as Wikipedia or a task-specific Knowledge Base, in a context-aware manner, and have been shown to perform well against knowledge-agnostic or symbolic context-agnostic approaches. This work highlights recent advances in memory network research, and several of its applications.
