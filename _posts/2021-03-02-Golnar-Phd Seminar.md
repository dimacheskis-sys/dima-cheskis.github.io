**Investigations into the Value of Labeled and Unlabeled Data in Biomedical Entity Recognition and Word Sense Disambiguation**

**Abstract:**
Human annotations, especially in highly technical domains, are expensive and time consuming to gather, and can also be erroneous. As a result, we never have sufficiently accurate data to train and evaluate supervised methods.In this thesis, we address this problem by taking a semi-supervised approach to biomedical named entity  recognition  (NER),  and  by  proposing  an  inventory-independent  evaluation  framework  for supervised and unsupervised word sense disambiguation.Our contributions are as follows:
•  We  introduce  a  novel  graph-based  semi-supervised  approach  to  named  entity  recognition(NER) and exploit pre-trained contextualized word embeddings in several biomedical NER tasks.
•  We propose a new evaluation framework for word sense disambiguation that permits a fair comparison  between  supervised  methods  trained  on  different  sense  inventories  as  well  as unsupervised methods without a fixed sense inventory.
