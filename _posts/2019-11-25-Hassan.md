In our lab meeting tomorrow, Hassan will give a depth presentation on Lexical
Constraints in NMT. In attendance will be his Ph.D. Examining Committee
members, Dr. Anoop Sarkar, Dr. Angel Chang, and Dr. Fred Popowich.

Here is the title and abstract:

**Imposing Bilingual Lexical Constraints to Neural Machine Translation**

**Abstract:**
*Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have reached astonishing results in
recent years, and yet infrequent words remain a problem to them as well as
out-of-domain terminologies.
Bilingual lexical resources can be used to guide the model through difficulties
when it faces infrequent and out-of-domain, vocabulary words. Hence, imposing
bilingual lexical preferences (constraints) into NMT models have received
rising attention in the past few years.

In this report, we summarize different threads of work on Constrained NMT
including approaches that modify the input or output of the model
(pre-processing and post-processing) without changing the model itself, as well
as, the approaches that change the inference algorithms and target vocabulary
set to satisfy the Bilingual Lexical Constraints.*
